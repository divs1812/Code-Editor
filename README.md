## Introduction

This project is a simple code editor built with React, inspired by [React Simple Code Editor](https://react-simple-code-editor.github.io/react-simple-code-editor/). 
The editor is designed to support syntax highlighting using PrismJS, specifically utilizing the `prism-react-renderer` library for seamless integration with React.
The core of the editor is a `textarea` HTML element, enhanced to provide a real-time, syntax-highlighted coding experience.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **PrismJS**: A lightweight and extensible syntax highlighting library.
  - **PrismJS**: For syntax highlighting in vanilla JavaScript. [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/)
  - **prism-react-renderer**: A React implementation of PrismJS, simplifying its integration into React components. [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
- **Textarea HTML Element**: Used as the base for the code editor, providing a native text input experience.

### Features

- Real-time syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
- Seamless integration with React using `prism-react-renderer`.
- Customizable and extendable to support additional features as needed.
